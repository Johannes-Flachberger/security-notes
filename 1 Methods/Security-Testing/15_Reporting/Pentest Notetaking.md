# Principles
- Take precise and concise notes.
- Document **everything** you do - every command & every file you modify.
- Only visualize one once concept in one screenshot.

Eg. for a Webapp vulnerability document the following:
- Application Name
- exact URL & request type
- Issue detail
- PoC payload
