# Overview
1. The purpose of the report.
2. How we can deliver the information we've collected in a way that the audience can understand.
# The purpose of a pentest report
The ultimate objective is to provide the client with a clear roadmap that identifies all existing weaknesses within the assessed systems, recommends immediate corrective actions, and defines long-term strategies to prevent similar vulnerabilities from arising in the future.
# How to deliver
## Principles
**Respect the preferences of the client**
Dont go into too much detail about parts where no vulnerabilities were found - unless the client explicitely wishes so.

**Respect the context of the client**
Depending on the context of the client, the same issue might have different severities.
Different mitigations strategies need to be applied depending on the context. E.g. for safety critical systems or systems with very high uptime requirements an immediate patch is not an option.

**Respect relevant regulations for the client**
E.g. PCI DSS certified companies are not allowed to use TLS 1.0, but it might be less critical for e.g. a hospital from a regulatory perspective.

**Respect the skill of the readers**
Provide both executive summaries and in-depth technical information for security professionals.
