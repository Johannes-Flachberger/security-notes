Active recon makes contact with the target.
Gather as detailed information as possible about exposed services - here are notes about some usually exposed services
# Goal:
Expand, enrich and deepen the knowledge gathered during passive recon.
# Methodology
In general: start to enumerate the attack surface broadly (network &  port scanning)
then enumerate specific services
## 1. Port Scanning & Service Detection

## 2. Vulnerability Scanning
