this is a test how we can use this to perform the same stuff as before with another keyboard or another thing that does not quite matter in the same way as we planned to. This is an interesting way to do stuff without doing less stuff and to be just the way you are this is a good test for this thing that you want to do and if that way it makes sense and to see if I can really make use of this. This is still an interesting decision to make a test what makes the most sense to me. Thus you can test if there is a test that can make the test better if you can test that  this is a nice change.
