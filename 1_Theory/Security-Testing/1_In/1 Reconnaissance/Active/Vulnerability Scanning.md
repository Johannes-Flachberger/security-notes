# Overview
The following steps are carried out by vulnerability scanners:
1. Host discovery
2. Port scanning
3. Operating system, service, and version detection
4. Matching the results to a vulnerability database
False positives can occur when bugfixes are backported to older package versions. Therefore, good vulnerability scanners add step 5: actively probing and validating if certain exploits are possible. This significantly recuduces false positives. 

**pro:**
- quick and efficient
- test wide range of vulns
- detect low hanging fruits
**con:**
- very loud -> cause a lot of logging
- can have an impact on the targeted systems
- often expensive
# Tools
Be sure to understand the inner workings and limitations of each vulnerability scanner you use.
- [[3_Tools/scanning/vulns/Nessus|Nessus]]
- [[3_Tools/scanning/vulns/OpenVAS|OpenVAS]]
- [[3_Tools/Metasploit framework/Metasploit|Metasploit]] also has scanners
- [[3_Tools/scanning/network/nmap#^eee943|nmap]] scripting engine
# Things to consider
## Scan duration
can vary greatly due to scope and context - e.g. how many hops need to be made for a public scan
## Target accessibility
Are firewalls in place, do we need a VPN?
- E.g. if scanning externally a client might have geofencing in place.
- E.g. (internal) routers might drop ICMP packets
- An IPS might kick in
## Traffic Rates
Rate limiting  might be in place & limit the scan results
If no rate limiting is in place, our scan could make the network unusable
## Target stability & availability
> [!Warning] 
> Vulnerability scanners can impact the stability or availability of targeted systems, since they may vailidate vulnerabilities by (partially) exploiting them.
# Scan Types
## External vs. Internal
**External:**
- Scans all publicly reachable assets: often web servers, systems in the DMZ & other public facing servers
**Internal:**
- Scans the internal infrastructure of systems, either on-site or per vpn access
## Unauthenticated vs. Authenticated
**Unauthenticated:**
- Scan a specific host from the outside - only what is externally visible can be checked
**Authenticated:**
- Provide valid credentials, so internals of a host can be scanned too
	- vulnerable packages
	- missing patches
	- configuration vulnerabilities
## Tool Comparison
### Pro Versions
**Nessus Pro**  
- **Pros**  
	- Polished, stable, and fast  
	- Largest vulnerability coverage  
	- Lighter storage requirements (optimized)  
	- Plugins are modular and compiled (efficient)  
	- Cross-platform support  
- **Cons**  
	- Expensive  

**OpenVAS / GVM**  
- **Pros**  
	- Free version available  
	- Paid Greenbone Security Feed is good (though less tested than Nessus)  
- **Cons**  
	- Less polished, slower scans, less stable  
	- Plugins (NVTs) are text-based, less modular  
	- Slightly weaker coverage than Nessus feed
