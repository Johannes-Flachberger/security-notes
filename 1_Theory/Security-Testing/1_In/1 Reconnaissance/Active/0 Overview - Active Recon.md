Active recon makes contact with the target.
Gather as detailed information as possible about exposed services - here are notes about some usually exposed services
# Goal:
Expand, enrich and deepen the knowledge gathered during passive recon.

# Methodology
Start to enumerate the attack surface broadly  (network &  port scanning)
then enumerate specific services
